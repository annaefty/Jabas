## Our name is Jabas and this is our project for the University in Programming with Java (II).

# Our Goal
## Our goal is to create a usefull Database run on the cmd of your computer.

# How it Works
## The user runs the file Start.java and the following menu appears: 

## Welcome to your database!
## Choose between the following options
## 0 : Add new data
## 1 : Remove existing data
## 2 : Display existing data
## 3 : Exit the database

# By pressing 0 
## The Database generates the number of the ID for your DATA, starting from 1. It gives you the first available ID and you add your data.
## After instering the data, it gives you the opportunity to insert more data by typing "yes"
## By pressing anything rather than "yes" you go back to the Main Menu.

# By pressing 1
## The Database asks you to insert the ID of the Data that you wish to delete
## After you insert the ID, it deletes it's content and moves you back to the main menu

## If databese is empty, you can see this message: "The database is Empty.Nothing to remove"
## If this particular ID is empty, for instance ID 1, then this message is displayed: "The item with id number 1 was not found"

# By Pressing 2
## Database shows every ID and data saved since you run the program
## If there are no data, the message "The database is Empty. Nothing to display!" is displayec
## And it redirects you to the main menu

# By pressing 3
## You exit the Database.
